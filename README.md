### How to use
Download the latest release from
https://github.com/chaorace/cqui/releases/

Find your DLC folder, usually on Windows it is:  
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\DLC
```

Extract the "cqui" folder to the DLC folder

### KNOWN ISSUES:

Attacking with cities takes two clicks on the strike button. (This is actually a bug in Civ VI)
The two X buttons in the Civ-V style cityview don't do anything. This will change later, but for now right click to exit the Cityview properly. Sames goes for pressing Esc: it doesn't work quite properly yet.
None other thus-far!

### TODO:

Show district adjacency bonuses in cityview or potentially globally
Buttons for cycling cities in cityview
Tweaking the minimap further (making it smaller or adding a smallmode?)
Making the yields in the top panel clickable
Right clicking ANY item in production view opens Civilopedia (currently doesn't work for disabled buildings/units)
